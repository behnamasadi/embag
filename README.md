# Embag: A really fast, simple bag file reader
This library is under active development and probably not useful at this point.

## Building
First, you'll need [Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html#install-on-ubuntu).  Then, run:

    bazel build //embag_echo:embag_echo
